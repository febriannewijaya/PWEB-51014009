" ALL WE KNOW "
-The Chainsmoker-

(Fighting flames of fire)
Hand on the burning wires
We don't care anymore
Art, we're fading never
We keep wasting colors
Maybe we should let this go

We're falling apart, still we hold together
We've passed the end so we chase forever
'Cause this is all we know
This feeling's all we know
I ride my bike up to the world
Down the streets right through the city
I'll go everywhere you go
From Chicago to the coast
You tell me, "Hit this and let's go
Blow the smoke right through the window"
'Cause this is all we know

'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know

Never face each other
One but different covers
We don't care anymore
Two hearts still beating
On with different rhythms
Maybe we should let this go

We're falling apart, still we hold together
We've passed the end so we chase forever
'Cause this is all we know
This feeling's all we know
I ride my bike up to the world
Down the streets right through the city
I'll go everywhere you go
From Chicago to the coast
You tell me, "Hit this and let's go
Blow the smoke right through the window"
'Cause this is all we know

'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know

('Cause this is all we know...)
