" ALL I ASK "
-Adele-

i will leave my heart at the door
i won't say a word
they've all been said before, you know
so why don't we just play pretend
like we're not scared of what is coming next
or scared of having nothing left

look don't get me wrong 
i know there is no tomorrow
all i ask is

if this is my last night with you
hold me like i'm more than just a friend
give mea memory i can use
take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
it matters how this ends
cause what if i never love again?

i don't need your honesty
it's already in your eyes
and i'm sure my eyes, they speak for me
no one knows me like you do
and since you're the only one that matters
tell me who do i run to?

look don't get me wrong 
i know there is no tomorrow
all i ask is

if this is my last night with you
hold me like i'm more than just a friend
give mea memory i can use
take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
it matters how this ends
cause what if i never love again?

let this be our lesson in love
let this be the way we remember us
i don't wanna be cruel or vicious
and i ain't asking for forgiveness
all i ask is

if this is my last night with you
hold me like i'm more than just a friend
give mea memory i can use
take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
it matters how this ends
cause what if i never love again?
